        <h2>My Innovation</h2>

        <h3>An app that can keep track of inventory and automatically order more without you having to worry.</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Eliminate some of the stress that business owners or managers have</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>How it helps</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>This will allow you to focus on other things rather than ordering inventory.</li>
                <li>Business owners spend a lot of time behind the computer ordering inventory and keeping track of it. Having an app that could do all of this for them would allow them to spend more time working on advertising and getting to know the customers. getting to know the consumer makes them feel appreciated and they are more likely to come back.</li>
                <li>This app would be directly connected to the computer system so that when it gets scanned at checkout, the app knows that the stock of that item went down and when it reaches a certain amount it can automatically order it.</li>
            </ul>
